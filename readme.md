## Introduction

This repository serves as a record of my progress and the practice problems I've tackled during my Java programming journey with the Apna College Alpha Plus batch. It's also a resource for fellow learners who might find these practice problems useful in their learning process.

## Topics Covered

The practice problems in this repository cover a wide range of Java programming topics, including but not limited to:
- Flowcharts and Pseudocodes
- Data Types and Variables
- Operators
- Control Statements (if else , if else if ,switch)
- Loops(while,do-while,for)

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference while learning Java.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each practice problem is stored in a date-wise folder.
- Within each folder, you will find the Java code and any relevant resources.

## Getting Started

To explore and use the practice problems in this repository, you'll need:

- A Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code (optional).

## Usage

To run a specific practice problem:

1. Navigate to the relevant date-wise folder.
2. Compile the Java file using the `javac` command.
3. Run the compiled program using the `java` command.


Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to gain a better understanding of the Java concepts covered in each practice problem
